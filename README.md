  - Cleaning data before training models to prevent bias and improve accuracy.

**Code:**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer

# Removing missing values
df.dropna()

# Handling missing values using mean imputation
imputer = Imputer(strategy='mean')
df['column_name'] = imputer.fit_transform(df[['column_name']])
```

### Feature Scaling:
- **Use Cases:**
  - Scaling features for algorithms that are sensitive to feature magnitudes.
  - Ensuring equal importance for all features in distance-based algorithms.

**Code:**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler

# Standardization
scaler = StandardScaler()
df['column_name'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['column_name']])

# Normalization
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df['column_name'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['column_name']])
```

### Encoding Categorical Variables:
- **Use Cases:**
  - Converting categorical variables into numerical representations for model compatibility.
  - Preserving the ordinal relationship between categories in label encoding.

**Code:**
```python

```

### Feature Extraction:
- **Use Cases:**
  - Converting raw data, such as text or images, into numerical representations.
  - Capturing the frequency, importance, or relevance of features in the data.

**Code:**
```python
